# Environmental-Kuznets-Curve-Analysis

### Econometric Methodology: Quadratic Specification
To test the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, I utilized a polynomial regression model. Unlike standard linear models, this quadratic specification allows for a non-linear relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation.

##### Hypothesis Testing:
If $\beta_1 > 0$ and $\beta_2 < 0$, the model supports the EKC theory of an "inverted U-shape."

This suggests that environmental quality acts as a "superior good"—something that citizens demand more of only after a certain threshold of wealth is reached.
